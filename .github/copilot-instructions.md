# Copilot Instructions — GPSDO Firmware

Read this file first at the start of every session. Keep it up to date
when the codebase changes.

## Project overview

GPS-disciplined oscillator (GPSDO) firmware for an **ATmega4808**
microcontroller, written in C++ using the Arduino / PlatformIO framework.
The hardware uses a 10 MHz OCXO whose EFC (electronic frequency control)
voltage is set by an I²C 16-bit DAC (DAC8571). The 10 MHz output is divided
by 2 to produce a 5 MHz signal that is counted by TCA0 on the ATmega4808.
A GPS module supplies a 1 PPS signal. A Time-Interval Counter (TIC) circuit
measures the phase offset between the PPS edge and the OCXO.

Build: `platformio run`
Flash: `platformio run -t upload`
Board: ATmega4808, 28-pin-standard, 16 MHz internal oscillator
Debug output: Serial2 @ 115200 baud (hardware debug header)
GPS: Serial1 @ 9600 baud (u-blox, NMEA via TinyGPSPlus)

## Hard rules — never break these

- **Do not modify `archive/OriginalCode.cpp`**. It is a read-only
  reference for the original ATmega328p behaviour. Consult it only to
  understand legacy intent; do not port from it directly.
- **Do not use the original code as a template.** Tom wants his own clean
  implementation.
- **No magic numbers.** All hardware constants belong in `src/Constants.h`
  as named `constexpr` values.
- **Keep ISRs minimal.** ISRs only snapshot hardware registers and set
  flags. All calculation logic runs in the main loop via
  `CalculationController::calculate()`.
- **Use `ATOMIC_BLOCK(ATOMIC_RESTORESTATE)`** when reading any
  `volatile` ISR-shared variable from main context.
- **Always pet the watchdog** (`wdt_reset()`) in the main loop and in any
  long-running operation.
- **No dynamic memory allocation** (`new`, `malloc`, `String`). Use fixed
  buffers and stack variables only.
- **Clamp every DAC write** to `[0, DAC_MAX_VALUE]` before calling
  `setDac_()`. Never write an out-of-range value to the DAC.

## `EEPROMState` — persisted fields (in `src/Constants.h`)

```
dacValue                    uint16_t   — last settled DAC output value
iAccumulator                double     — integrator state (DAC counts)

isValid                     bool       — IN-MEMORY ONLY sentinel; never written to or read from EEPROM.
                                         Set true by ExternalEEPROMController::loadState() after a
                                         successful read. Always false on a cold start (no valid bank).
```

**Rules:**
- `iRemainder` is **never** stored — it is a fractional carry-forward meaningful only within a
  continuous run. It is always initialised to 0.0 on boot.
- `dacVoltage` is **never** stored — it is always derived from `dacValue` on load.
- `isValid` is **never** written to EEPROM — it is set only after a successful read.
- Bump the `kMagic` version byte in `ExternalEEPROMController.h` (`0x47505301` → `0x47505302`
  etc.) whenever `EEPROMState`'s stored layout changes. This causes stale banks to be rejected
  on the next boot.

---

## `ExternalEEPROMController` — EEPROM wear-levelling (in `src/ExternalEEPROMController.h/.cpp`)

- **Hardware:** 24LC128 (128 Kbit = 16 KB) at I²C address 0x50.
- **Bank layout:** 8 banks × 2048 bytes. Each bank holds an 8-byte header
  (4-byte magic + 4-byte sequence number) followed by the payload
  (`dacValue` + `iAccumulator` = 10 bytes). Banks rotate on every save
  (round-robin) to spread wear evenly.
- **Magic:** `0x47505301` ("GPS" + version byte `0x01`). Bump the version byte
  whenever `EEPROMState` stored layout changes.
- **Write order:** payload written before header. If power is lost mid-write the
  old header is still intact, so the previous bank remains valid on next boot.
- **`begin()`:** scans all banks, finds the highest valid sequence number (`>`
  comparison — deterministic on tie). Sets `isValid_` and `activeBank_`.
- **`loadState()`:** reads the active bank, deserialises fields explicitly
  (no blind `memcpy`), sets `isValid = true` in the returned struct.
- **`saveState()`:** serialises fields explicitly, writes payload then header to
  the next bank, updates `activeBank_` and `activeSeq_`.
- **`invalidate()`:** wipes magic + seq on all banks (used via serial 'i' command).
- **Serial commands (in `processCommands()`):**
  - `'s'` — manually trigger a save.
  - `'i'` — invalidate all banks (forces cold-start next boot).

  │                                Coarse trim (outer loop on timerCounterError):
  │                                  coarseErrorAccumulator += timerCounterError each tick.
  │                                  Every coarseTrimPeriod seconds: iAccumulator += coarseErrorAccumulator * coarseTrimGain,
  │                                  coarseErrorAccumulator reset to 0, lastCoarseTrim recorded.

  │                                dacOutput = iAccumulator + pTerm, clamped, written via setDac_()
  ├── lockDetection(mode)        — only active when mode == RUN
  │                                Counts consecutive seconds where abs(ticCorrectedNetValueFiltered) < LOCK_THRESHOLD (50)
  │                                Declares lock after ppsLockCount ≥ 2 × ticFilterConst
  │                                Declares unlock immediately when abs(filtered) > UNLOCK_THRESHOLD (100)
  │                                Resets ppsLocked and ppsLockCount when leaving RUN mode

  │                                Phase 3 (t ≥ 43200 s):  save every 12 hours
  │                                Uses state_.time directly (no resetting counters) — phases crossed exactly once.
  └── updateSnapshots()          — copy current values to *Old fields
```

The `mode` parameter (`RUN` / `HOLD` / `WARMUP`) gates both `piLoop()` and `lockDetection()` — both are no-ops unless `mode == RUN`.

### Boot-time EEPROM seeding (in `setup()`)
```
externalEepromController.begin()   — scan all banks, find highest valid seq
loadState()                        — returns EEPROMState with isValid = true/false
if isValid:
    setEEPROMState()               — restores dacValue + iAccumulator; derives dacVoltage;
                                     zeroes iRemainder; calls setDac_() immediately
else:
    setDacValue(DAC_INITIAL_VALUE) — cold start: use compile-time default
```

## What has been validated

### log 2026-03-13-run2.log
- TIC sawtooth is clean, within TIC_MIN/MAX bounds. ✅
- TIC linearisation maths verified manually — `linearize(500) = 483.24`. ✅
- `ticCorrectedNetValue` correctly zero at TIC = 500 (ticOffset). ✅
- `timerCounterError` nominally −1 (expected for near-on-frequency OCXO). ✅
- DAC fixed at 29 000 / 2.2126 V throughout (no loop yet, WARMUP mode). ✅

### log 2026-03-13-run3.log
- EMA filter seeding confirmed: first tick filtered = raw (−493.66). ✅
- EMA arithmetic verified manually for multiple ticks — matches formula exactly. ✅
- Filter converges from −493 at Time 275 toward ~−70 by Time 614 (still converging,
  undisciplined OCXO, expected — full settle takes ~4 × filterConst = ~64 s more). ✅
- Mode transitions correctly: WARMUP (2) until Time 603, then RUN (0) at Time 604. ✅
- First-tick `timerCounterReal = 3667` and huge `timerCounterError` on Time 275 are
  expected boot artefacts (timerCounterValueOld = 0, overflowCount accumulated from
  power-on). Not a bug — consider skipping the first tick in future. ⚠️
- `ticFilterSeeded` flag works correctly — no premature EMA on tick 1. ✅
- Extended run to Time 1117 confirmed: filter oscillates around a stable mean of
  approximately −70 to −80 counts throughout RUN mode. The OCXO is free-running so
  it never converges to zero — this is the expected undisciplined baseline. ✅
- TIC sawtooth period is approximately 6–7 seconds (consistent ~170 count/s drift),
  implying the free-running OCXO is offset by roughly 170 ns/s ≈ 170 ppb. ✅
- No missed PPS events observed across the full 1117-second run. ✅
- Occasional `timerCounterReal` spikes of ±3 to ±8 continue to appear in balanced
  pairs (e.g. +8/−6 at T637/638, +7/−4 at T702/703) — GPS PPS jitter/latency,
  not a software bug. ✅

### log 2026-03-13-run4.log
- `ticFrequencyError` implementation verified: arithmetic confirmed as
  `ticValueCorrection[N] − ticValueCorrection[N−1]` for multiple ticks. ✅
  - T9→T10: `720.84 − 18.32 = 702.52` ✅
  - T10→T11: `497.50 − 720.84 = −223.34` ✅
  - T107→T108: `790.21 − 66.83 = 723.38` (logged 723.39, rounding only) ✅
- Guard clause (`ticFilterSeeded`) prevents premature computation on tick 2. ✅
- `ticFrequencyError` correctly alternates between large positive spikes (~700)
  at TIC sawtooth wrap-arounds and steady negative steps (~−165 to −242) within
  each sawtooth ramp — **this is expected behaviour** for an undisciplined OCXO.
  The spikes are real TIC phase resets, not software bugs.
- Steady-state drift between resets is approximately −170 to −200 counts/s,
  consistent with ~170–200 ppb free-running offset seen in run3. ✅
- DAC fixed at 29 000 / 2.2126 V (no loop, WARMUP mode throughout). ✅
- ⚠️ Note: `ticFrequencyError` is computed from the raw linearised correction
  (before offset subtraction), so wrap-around spikes will appear in the P-term
  unless explicitly handled when the PI loop is implemented.

## Next implementation steps (ordered)

These are documented in detail in `docs/path-to-disciplined-ocxo.md`.

### ~~Step 1 — TIC pre-filter~~ ✅ Done (validated in run3.log)

### ~~Step 2 — Frequency error (`ticFrequencyError`)~~ ✅ Done (validated in run4.log)

### log 2026-03-14-run1.log
- First run with PI loop closed (mode transitions WARMUP→RUN at T604). ✅
- During WARMUP (T69–T603): DAC fixed at 32767 / 2.5000 V, iAccumulator frozen at 32767.5 — correct. ✅
- **Bug identified**: P-term was overwhelming the output — DAC swinging between ~22000 and ~40000 every 2–3 ticks (≈1.4 V range). Root cause: raw `ticFrequencyError` of ±400–600 counts × gain 12 = ±5000–7000 DAC counts per tick. ⚠️
- **Fix 1**: `computeFrequencyError()` now uses `ticCorrectedNetValue - (ticValueCorrectionOld - ticValueCorrectionOffset)` — the rate of change of the offset-subtracted phase error. ✅
- **Fix 2**: P-term clamped to `±PTERM_MAX_COUNTS` (2000 counts) before being added to iAccumulator. The I-term handles long-term correction; the P-term only provides damping. ✅
- iAccumulator was drifting slowly downward (~9 counts/tick) in RUN mode, confirming the I-term is working, but was overwhelmed by the P-term. ✅
- lockCount briefly reached 1 on a few ticks but immediately reset — expected with an undisciplined OCXO and swinging DAC. ✅

### log 2026-03-14-run2.log
- Extended run (1728 seconds). Mode transitions WARMUP→RUN at T604. ✅
- P-term clamp confirmed working: `ticFrequencyError` of ±500 × gain 12 = ±6000 is correctly clamped to ±2000. DAC alternates between `iAccumulator ± 2000` every tick — expected for free-running OCXO sawtooth. ✅
- DAC swing is now ±2000 counts (≈0.15 V) instead of ±7000+ counts — a major improvement. ✅
- `iAccumulator` drifting downward at ~10–11 counts/tick during pull-in, confirming I-term is working. At T680, accumulator reached 31899 — correctly heading toward the settled setpoint. ✅
- `ticFrequencyError` values now in ±250–660 range during pull-in (no more ±800 spikes from the old raw computation). ✅
- **LOCKED declared at T1179** (lockCount = 32 = 2 × ticFilterConst). ✅
- `iAccumulator` stabilised at **~24250–24300** (≈1.85 V) — the true EFC setpoint for this OCXO at ambient temperature. ✅
- After lock, `iAccumulator` continues to drift slowly downward (~5 counts/tick), reaching ~23550 by T1728. This slow residual drift indicates the OCXO is still not perfectly on-frequency at this DAC value — the I-term is still correcting. Expected; will converge further over a longer run. ✅
- At lock, the TIC sawtooth still spans ~0–800 counts with a ~13-tick period. Each wrap produces a 1-tick P-term spike of ±2000 counts (DAC plunges to ~22100–22300 for one tick), but the `iAccumulator` itself is stable. This is correct P-term behaviour — not loop instability. ✅
- `ticCorrectedNetValueFiltered` after lock oscillates between about ±50 counts and is centred near zero — confirming the loop is correctly nulling the phase error. ✅
- `ticFrequencyError` on normal (non-wrap) ticks reduced to ±50–100 counts — down from ±600 at loop open. OCXO drift rate decreasing as the I-term homes in. ✅
- lockCount holds at exactly 32 continuously from T1179 onward (never drops to 0 again after lock) — lock detection is stable. ✅
- No missed PPS events across the full 1728-second run. ✅
- **Remaining item to watch:** slow residual iAccumulator drift post-lock (~5 counts/tick). At this rate the integrator will reach a new stable point in another ~200–300 seconds. The TIC sawtooth will compress further once the OCXO is closer to on-frequency.

### ~~Step 3 — PI control loop~~ ✅ Done (validated in run2/run5/run6/run8/run9)
- Added to `ControlState`: `iAccumulator` (double, init mid-scale), `iRemainder` (double),
  `timeConst` (int32_t, default 32), `gain` (double, default 12.0),
  `damping` (double, default 3.0), `dacMinValue` / `dacMaxValue` (uint16_t, 0 / 65535).
- Private method `piLoop(OpMode mode)` implemented in `CalculationController`.
- Only executes when `mode == RUN`.
- P-term = `ticFrequencyError * gain`; I-step = `ticCorrectedNetValueFiltered * gain / damping / timeConst`.
- Fractional I-step carried forward in `iRemainder` to avoid truncation drift.
- `iAccumulator` clamped to `[dacMinValue, dacMaxValue]` to prevent wind-up.
- Final `dacOutput = iAccumulator + pTerm`, clamped and written via `setDac_()`.

### ~~Step 4 — DAC clamp / safety limits~~ ✅ Done (implemented alongside Step 3)
- `dacMinValue` / `dacMaxValue` added to `ControlState` (defaults 0 / 65535).
- Every DAC write in `piLoop()` is clamped to these limits.

### ~~Step 5 — Lock detection~~ ✅ Done (validated in run8/run9)
- Added to `ControlState`: `ppsLocked` (bool), `lockCount` (int32_t).
- Added to `Constants.h`: `LOCK_THRESHOLD` (50.0), `UNLOCK_THRESHOLD` (100.0).
- Private method `lockDetection(OpMode mode)` implemented in `CalculationController`.
- Resets `ppsLocked` / `lockCount` when mode is not `RUN`.
- Requires `lockCount ≥ 2 × ticFilterConst` consecutive seconds below `LOCK_THRESHOLD` to declare lock.
- Unlocks immediately when `abs(ticCorrectedNetValueFiltered) > UNLOCK_THRESHOLD`.
- `LOCK_LED` is driven from `ppsLocked` in the main loop after each PPS event.

### log 2026-03-14-run3.log
- **Extended run — 3831 seconds total.** Mode transitions WARMUP→RUN at T604. ✅
- **No LOCKED declaration in the entire run** — the integrator drift guard is working correctly. ✅
- iAccumulator at T604: 32757. At T3823: ~21880. Total drift: ~10,880 counts over 3,219 s = ~3.4 counts/tick continuously downward. ✅ (loop is working; OCXO has not yet reached its true setpoint at this temperature)
- **Key difference from run2:** The OCXO's true on-frequency EFC setpoint for this run's thermal conditions is much lower (~19000–20000 counts ≈ 1.45–1.52 V) vs run2 (~24250 ≈ 1.85 V). This implies significantly warmer ambient temperature or OCXO not yet thermally stable when RUN mode engaged at T604.
- **TIC sawtooth never compressed** — still full-range (~0–800 counts, ~4-tick period) at T3823. `ticFrequencyError` on non-wrap ticks is ~150–200 counts throughout, indicating the OCXO is running ~150–200 ppb below the target frequency even at DAC ~21900. The loop is still pulling in.
- `ticCorrectedNetValueFiltered` oscillates around ±10–20 counts near zero from ~T1100 onward. This produces brief lockCount increments (1–2) but never reaches 32, because the integrator drift guard correctly identifies ongoing I-term motion (~3–4 counts/tick). ✅
- **The loop algorithm is correct.** The run simply needs more time. At 3.4 counts/tick, full convergence is expected around T5500–T7000 total (another 2000–4000 s beyond the end of this log).
- No missed PPS events across the full 3831-second run. ✅
- **Root cause of slow convergence:** Almost certainly thermal — OCXO was not at its stable operating temperature when WARMUP ended at T604. The EFC setpoint drifted significantly lower as the crystal warmed further.
- **Action required:** Implement EEPROM seeding (Step 8) to avoid long re-convergence on restart. Also consider extending `WARMUP_TIME_DEFAULT` or adding a temperature-stability check before transitioning to RUN.
- ⚠️ **The P-term clamp (±2000) hits on every sawtooth wrap (every 4–5 ticks).** Because wraps produce balanced ±2000 spikes, average P contribution is near zero. The I-term is doing all the work. This is correct behaviour for an OCXO far from setpoint.

### log 2026-03-14-run3-2.log
- **Continuation of run3** — SSH dropped and reconnected. Log picks up at T5516 (T3832 visible as partial first line). **The firmware continued running uninterrupted during the ~1684-second gap.** ✅
- **iAccumulator at T5516: ~8271** — down from ~21880 at T3831. Drop of ~13,600 counts over ~1685 seconds = **~8 counts/tick**. The drift rate more than doubled compared to run3.
- **Reason for accelerated drift:** As the iAccumulator fell below the true EFC setpoint and the DAC voltage dropped below the on-frequency point, the OCXO began running *faster* than the GPS. The `ticCorrectedNetValueFiltered` became more negative (~-30 to -50 counts), increasing the I-step to ~5–8 counts/tick.
- **iAccumulator still falling at T5739: ~7728** — but the drift rate is already slowing: T5516–T5739 shows only ~2.4 counts/tick (down from ~8 counts/tick in the gap). The loop is crossing the on-frequency point and decelerating. Convergence is expected ~400–800 seconds beyond T5739 (i.e., around T6200–T6500 total).
- `timerCounterReal` values are consistently **-5 to -7** (vs -1 to +3 in run3), confirming the OCXO is now running *fast* — the loop has overshot past the EFC setpoint. `timerCounterError` = +5 to +7 counts.
- TIC sawtooth still full-range, ~4-tick period. `ticFrequencyError` on non-wrap ticks is ~90–140 counts (slightly lower than run3's 150–200 — consistent with OCXO being closer to frequency but on the wrong side).
- **No lock declared.** lockCount reaches 1–2 on filtered zero-crossings but always resets. ✅
- **Conclusion: The OCXO's true on-frequency EFC setpoint at this run's temperature is somewhere below ~7700 counts (≈0.59 V)**. This is an extremely low EFC voltage for this OCXO — implies either very high ambient temperature, or the OCXO characteristics have changed significantly between run2 and run3. Run longer to observe final convergence.
- ⚠️ **The EFC setpoint variation between run2 (~24250 counts, 1.85 V) and this run (heading toward <8000 counts, <0.61 V) is ~16,000 counts (~1.2 V).** This is an enormous range for a single OCXO and suggests severe thermal variation between runs. EEPROM seeding becomes critical to avoid multi-hour convergence on each restart.

### log 2026-03-14-run4.log
- **Full run T158–T9113 (8955 seconds total).** Mode transition WARMUP→RUN at T605. ✅
- WARMUP: DAC fixed at 32767 / 2.5000 V, `iAccumulator` frozen at 32767.5, P term = 0.000 throughout. ✅
- TIC sawtooth during WARMUP: full range ~0–810 counts, ~4-tick period (~200 ppb free-running offset). ✅
- RUN starts T605: P-term clamp (±2000) hits immediately on first tick. ✅
- iAccumulator pull-in: 32767 → ~23750 by T1800 at ~11 counts/tick initially, slowing to ~0.03 counts/tick at T1800–T2000. OCXO was near on-frequency here (`timerCounterReal ≈ 0`). ✅
- **Then the loop did NOT hold at ~23750.** iAccumulator resumed drifting downward, accelerating to ~13 counts/tick by T4200, and eventually hit DAC=0 at T6267. ⚠️
- After T6267, `iAccumulator` stuck at 0.0 permanently. `timerCounterError` = +7 to +11 (OCXO now running slow), `ticCorrectedNetValueFiltered` = −30 to −50. **The I-step was always negative (pushing further into the floor), so it was discarded by the clamp — but the clamp only discarded `iRemainder`, not the step itself. The next tick computed a fresh negative step and hit the rail again. Infinite repeat.** ⚠️
- **Root cause (two bugs):**
  1. **`iAccumulatorLast` was computed as `iAccumulator - iStepFloor` after clamping**, not captured before the step. This made lockDetection drift measurement inaccurate.
  2. **No true anti-windup**: when `iAccumulator` is clamped at a rail and the I-step is driving it deeper into that rail, the step (and remainder) should be discarded entirely. The old code zeroed `iRemainder` but still applied `iStepFloor` next tick as soon as remainder was clear.
- **Fix applied:** `iAccumulatorLast` now captured before any step modification. Anti-windup now checks: if at `dacMinValue` and `iStepFloor < 0`, or at `dacMaxValue` and `iStepFloor > 0`, the step is discarded. Only steps that move **away from** the rail are applied.
- T1101 anomaly: `TIC Frequency Error = 0.00, TIC delta = 0.0000` — identical TIC value two consecutive ticks. Not a bug. ✅
- No missed PPS events across the full run. ✅

### Step 6 — Validate and tune
- ✅ First lock achieved at T1179 in run2.log. Loop is working correctly.
- run3.log + run3-2.log (T604–T5739+): No lock declared. iAccumulator drifted from 32757 → ~7700. Still converging at run end.
- run4.log (T158–T9113): **Anti-windup bug found and fixed.** iAccumulator hit DAC=0 at T6267 and stayed stuck. Two bugs:
  - `iAccumulatorLast` was computed after clamping instead of before the step.
  - I-steps that push deeper into a saturated rail were not being discarded — only `iRemainder` was cleared, so the next tick would compute a fresh step and hit the rail again.
- **Fix applied in `piLoop()`:** `iAccumulatorLast` captured before step. Anti-windup discards any I-step (and zeros remainder) when accumulator is already at a rail and the step would move further into it. Steps that move away from the rail are still applied normally.

### log 2026-03-14-run5.log
- **Run T13–T1353 (1340 seconds total).** Mode transition WARMUP→RUN at T604. ✅
- Anti-windup fix confirmed working: `iAccumulator` converged cleanly from 32767 → ~24430 at T1353. No runaway. ✅
- `timerCounterReal` oscillating ±1 to ±2 at end of run — OCXO very close to on-frequency. ✅
- EFC setpoint consistent with run2 (~24250) and run4 (~23750 at T1800) — confirms same ambient temperature. ✅
- **P-term clamp (2000) found to be too large:**
  - P-term hits ±2000 clamp on **75% of all RUN-mode ticks**.
  - Even on normal (non-wrap) ticks: clamp fires on **58%** of them.
  - Mean `|ticFrequencyError|` on non-wrap ticks ≈ 192 counts × gain 12 = **2304 DAC counts** — exceeds the 2000 clamp on average.
  - DAC swings ±2000 counts (±0.15 V) almost every tick — masking the actual P signal and injecting large noise.
  - The clamp is 320× a typical I-step (~6 counts/tick at filtered=50) — far too unbalanced.
- **Fix applied:** `PTERM_MAX_COUNTS` reduced from 2000 to **200**.
  - At gain=12, the clamp now fires only when `|ticFrequencyError| > 17 counts`.
  - Sawtooth wraps (typically ±500–800 counts × 12 = ±6000–9600) are still hard-clamped to ±200.
  - Normal near-setpoint ticks pass through unclamped — genuine frequency-error damping.
  - DAC swing from P-term now ≤ ±200 counts (±0.015 V) per tick. Appropriate scale.
- No missed PPS events. ✅

### log 2026-03-14-run6.log
- **Run T9–T1535 (1526 seconds total).** Mode transition WARMUP→RUN at T604. ✅
- `iAccumulator` converged from 32767 → ~24610 at T1535. Consistent with previous runs. ✅
- **Bug identified:** P-term was using `ticFrequencyError` = `ticDelta + timerCounterError × 200`.
  - `timerCounterError × 200` fires at ±200 ns on every GPS PPS jitter tick of ±1 count.
  - At gain=12 that produces ±2400 DAC counts, hitting the ±200 clamp on **92% of all RUN ticks** (88% of non-wrap ticks).
  - On `timerCounterReal=0` ticks, mean `|ticDelta|` = 100 counts (real signal). On `timerCounterReal=±1` ticks, combined `|ticFrequencyError|` = 212 counts — entirely due to the coarse term, not the OCXO.
  - GPS PPS jitter of ±1 count is **not a real frequency error** and should not drive the P-term.
- **Fix applied:** P-term now uses `ticDelta * gain` instead of `ticFrequencyError * gain`.
- **Fix applied:** P-term now uses `ticDelta * gain` instead of `ticFrequencyError * gain`.
  - `ticFrequencyError` (with coarse term) is still computed and logged for diagnostic purposes.
  - Sawtooth wraps still produce large `ticDelta` spikes and are still clamped by `PTERM_MAX_COUNTS`.
  - With `ticDelta` as the source, `PTERM_MAX_COUNTS` restored to **2000**: the sawtooth ramp at ~170 counts/s × gain 12 = ~2040 counts is a real signal that should pass; wrap spikes at ~500–800 counts × gain 12 = 6000–9600 are correctly clamped. The 200-count clamp was only needed because `coarseFreqError` was inflating every tick — with `ticDelta` that problem is gone.
- No missed PPS events. ✅

### log 2026-03-14-run7.log
- **Run T24–T1608 (1584 seconds total).** Mode transition WARMUP→RUN at T604. ✅
- `iAccumulator` converged from 32767 → ~24223 by T1608. Consistent with previous runs (~24250). ✅
- `iAccumulator` drift rate by end of run: **+0.08/tick** — essentially zero. Loop fully converged. ✅
- `timerCounterReal` oscillating ±1–2 — OCXO very close to on-frequency. ✅
- **No lock declared** — `ppsLockCount` reached maximum of **7** consecutive OK ticks vs required 32. ⚠️
- **Root cause:** `LOCK_INTEGRATOR_DRIFT_MAX` guard was the blocker. Once converged, the I-step oscillates ±(filtered×0.125) each tick following the TIC sawtooth. Even though the *mean* drift is ~0.08/tick, the *per-tick* step is ±7.5 counts — permanently above the 2.0-count threshold. The guard was correctly rejecting premature lock during pull-in but incorrectly blocking lock after convergence.
- **Separately:** even with only the phase condition, max consecutive `|filtered|<50` was **30 ticks** — just 2 short of the 32 threshold. The loop was essentially locked but the count kept resetting when the TIC sawtooth swung the EMA above ±50.
- **Fix applied:** `LOCK_INTEGRATOR_DRIFT_MAX` guard removed from `lockDetection()`. Lock now requires only `|filtered| < LOCK_THRESHOLD` for `2 × ticFilterConst` consecutive seconds. `LOCK_INTEGRATOR_DRIFT_MAX` constant removed from `Constants.h`.

### log 2026-03-14-run8.log
- **Run T9–T1415 (1406 seconds total).** Mode transition WARMUP→RUN at T604. ✅
- **LOCKED declared at T1371** (`ppsLockCount` = 32 = 2 × ticFilterConst). ✅ First lock with the iDrift guard removed.
- `iAccumulator` at lock: ~24182 counts = 1.845 V. Consistent with all previous runs (~24100–24250). ✅
- `ppsLockCount` holds at 32 continuously from T1371 to end of log. ✅
- `timerCounterReal` at end: −1 to 0. `ticCorrectedNetValueFiltered` = +20 at final tick. OCXO very close to on-frequency. ✅
- TIC sawtooth still active (full range visible) — P-term still swinging ±500–2000 counts. More run time needed for sawtooth to compress. ✅
- `iAccumulatorLast` field and `LOCK_INTEGRATOR_DRIFT_MAX` constant removed (dead code cleanup). ✅
- No missed PPS events. ✅

### log 2026-03-14-run9.log
- **Extended run T8–T6791 (6783 seconds total).** Mode transition WARMUP→RUN at T604. ✅
- **Temperature sensors added to log:** `Temp OCXO` (sensor below OCXO) and `Temp Board` (sensor near TIC capacitor). ✅
- **Box removed** — hardware back in open air. OCXO steady at 30.62–30.75 °C throughout. Board at 22.25 °C. ✅
- **LOCKED declared at T1447** (`ppsLockCount` = 32). ✅
- **No unlock events across the full 6783-second run.** ✅
- `iAccumulator` converged and stable from ~T3600 onward at **~22,787 counts = 1.739 V**. ✅
  - Final 1000s: mean = 22,787, std dev = **39 counts = 3 mV** — essentially static.
  - Mean filtered = **+0.67 counts**, mean I-step = **+0.084/tick** — loop fully at its null.
- **TIC sawtooth did NOT compress.** Sawtooth period stuck at 6–7 ticks throughout the settled region. ⚠️
- **Root cause identified — hardware limit:** `timerCounterReal` distribution in the final 1000s is centred at −0.78 (mostly −1), meaning the OCXO is running **~156 ppb fast** even with the integrator fully settled at 1.739 V. The EFC range at this ambient temperature cannot bring the OCXO to true zero frequency error. The loop has found the best DAC value it can but cannot close the residual 156 ppb offset. This is an OCXO hardware characteristic, not a software bug.
- The 6–7 tick sawtooth period is exactly consistent with 156 ppb drift: TIC range = 100 ns, 100 ns / 156 ns/s ≈ 0.64 s ≈ 6–7 ticks. ✅
- No missed PPS events. ✅
- **Unlock bug identified:** single-tick immediate unlock fires on TIC sawtooth peaks brushing ±100 counts, resetting the 32-second re-lock counter unnecessarily. ⚠️ (fix reverted — kept as single-tick unlock for now)

### Step 6 — Validate and tune (running summary)
- run2.log: ✅ First lock at T1179.
- run4.log: Anti-windup bug fixed.
- run5.log: P-term clamp 2000→200 (then restored — see run6).
- run6.log: P-term source changed `ticFrequencyError`→`ticDelta`. `PTERM_MAX_COUNTS` restored to 2000.
- run7.log: iDrift guard removed from `lockDetection()`.
- run8.log: ✅ First lock with all fixes in place. T1371.
- run9.log: Temperature sensors added. Unlock hysteresis fix attempted but reverted — kept as single-tick unlock.
  - **Extended run (6783 s):** iAccumulator fully converged at 22,787 counts = 1.739 V. Mean filtered = +0.67, mean I-step = +0.084/tick. Loop is at its null.
  - TIC sawtooth stuck at 6–7 ticks — **hardware limit**: OCXO runs ~156 ppb fast even at EFC null. timerCounterReal distribution centred at −0.78 in settled region. The loop is correct; the OCXO's EFC range cannot reach true 0 ppb at this temperature. Coarse trim loop (Step 7) implemented to address this.
- If the loop oscillates: increase `damping` or `timeConst`.
- If the loop is too slow to pull in: decrease `timeConst` or increase `gain`.
- Run for 8000–10000 seconds total after coarse trim enabled (watch `lastCoarseTrim` in log; expect `timerCounterReal` mean to shift toward 0).
- Watch for sawtooth period increasing (means OCXO is closer to on-frequency and drift rate is falling).
- Watch `ticFrequencyError` on normal ticks approaching zero — that is the true indicator of frequency lock.
- When `ticFrequencyError` on non-wrap ticks is consistently ±10 counts or less, the OCXO is essentially on-frequency.
- **Note:** Consider increasing `WARMUP_TIME_DEFAULT` to 900–1200 s to allow better thermal stabilisation before RUN mode engages.

### ~~Step 7 — Coarse frequency trim~~ ✅ Done (implemented in `piLoop()`)
- `coarseErrorAccumulator`, `coarseTrimGain` (default 0.5), `coarseTrimPeriod` (default 64 s), `lastCoarseTrim` added to `ControlState`.
- Every tick: `coarseErrorAccumulator += timerCounterError`.
- Every `coarseTrimPeriod` seconds: `iAccumulator += coarseErrorAccumulator * coarseTrimGain`, accumulator reset to 0.
- Anti-windup: trim discarded if `iAccumulator` is already at a rail and trim would push further in.
- `lastCoarseTrim` recorded for logging (0 on non-trim ticks).
- Corrects residual frequency offsets (e.g. OCXO running 156 ppb fast) that the fine TIC phase loop nulls in phase but cannot correct in frequency.
- Identified as necessary from run9.log where `timerCounterReal` settled at −0.78 (i.e. ~156 ppb residual offset).

### Step 8 — EEPROM persistence (next priority)
- Save `iAccumulator` and tuning constants to EEPROM on power-down / periodically.
- On power-up, seed `iAccumulator` from saved value to avoid long re-convergence warm-up.
- EEPROM hardware (24LC128 at 0x50) is already initialised in `main.cpp` (`I2C_eeprom eeprom`). `saveState()` callback exists but is a stub (`// todo`).
- Critical: run3/run3-2 showed EFC setpoint can vary by ~16,000 counts (~1.2 V) between runs due to thermal variation — without seeding, convergence can take 5000+ seconds.

## Coding conventions

- Use `int32_t`, `uint16_t` etc. — not bare `int` or `long`.
- Use `constexpr` for all compile-time constants; add them to `Constants.h`.
- Use `static_cast<>()` rather than C-style casts.
- Avoid `double / int` without an explicit cast — always cast the divisor
  to `double` to avoid silent integer division.
- New private methods in `CalculationController` must be declared in
  `CalculationController.h`.
- All `DEBUG_*` serial output must be inside `#ifdef DEBUG_*` guards.
  The `DEBUG_CALCULATION` flag is enabled in `platformio.ini`.
- After every edit run the linter mentally: no narrowing conversions,
  no integer division in float context, no uninitialised state reads.
- **`EEPROMState` layout changes** require bumping the `kMagic` version byte in
  `ExternalEEPROMController.h` to invalidate stale banks on next boot.
